# Introduction

This is an application I wrote from scratch as part of my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. This application uses Google Maps Javascript API and the [Georgia Tech Places API](http://gtjourney.gatech.edu/gt-devhub/apis/places) to map out all the buildings on the Georgia Tech (my alma mater!) campus. Users can filter out certain locations in the filter pane on the left to only see certain buildings. This code makes use of the [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) framework. This is a fully responsive application and so will work on screens of all sizes.

# How to Download
To use this application, simply download this repository, unzip, and then open the index.html file in your favorite browser.

# Features
* Click on the menu button in the top left to bring up a filter pane that lists out all the currently displayed buildings

* Search in the search input field to find a specific building

* Click on markers or the building name in the filter pane to bring up an information window for that building's marker

* Markers animate (bounce) when you click on them (or their respective name in the filter pane)
